# TrainScheduler

Link: https://kobbootcamp.github.io/TrainScheduler/

The challenge for this project is to create a train schedule based on an initial start time, and a frequency (in minutes) that the train will arrive again.
The user enters a train name, destination, intial start time, and frequency. 
The train scheduler then adds the train to the current train schedule, which is stored in Firebase.
The added train's next arrive and minutes away is calculated based on the current time.

This app uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, Firebase, and moment.js.
